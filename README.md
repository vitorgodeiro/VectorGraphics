The illustrations of Bunny, Reschart, Drops and Embrace took to render 10s, 22s, 454s and 408s respectively.

## About
Developed at 2D Computer Graphics summer course on the [Institute of Pure and Applied Mathematics (IMPA)](https://impa.br/). 
This render is able to draw quadratic and cubic Bézier curves, transparency, linear and radial gradients, supersampling and acceleration datastructures. 

To execution the code it's necessary the framework provided by prof. Diego Nehab and for such the only files availables here was the results of tasks. 
The framework can be accessed in [Prof. Nehab's page](http://w3.impa.br/~diego/teaching) and find the page the latest 2D Computer Graphics course offered.
